1. Make sure you have a right python version installed locally

2. `your_project_name` is your project name including src.

3. Check `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` and configre them appropriately.

4. Set up python virtual environment - This is an optional step which I always prefre to do so.

    ```
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
